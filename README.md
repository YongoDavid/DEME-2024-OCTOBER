New day , new gring !!!
My qwasar drop-box application seems to be working well now but there are a few thing that i need to work on
and that is the mission of today , to finish and submit my drop-box application.
so lets see how it goes!

Firebase back-end is done and working the way i want it to work.
All that is left is to improve the UI the i will submit this project.
Getting drop-box to run lately has been very challenging and suer annoying. 
But i still need to figure it out.

Oct 03
Docode has alot of issues and has been pissing me off when it come to runing my drop-box application.
i will just host the project from my local machine to github and then host on vercel then submit.
For now i will be focusing on the upcoming assestement that i have.
